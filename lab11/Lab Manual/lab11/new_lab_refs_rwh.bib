	Abstract = {The primary challenge in wireless sensor network deployment is the limited network lifetime due to finite-capacity batteries. Hence, the vast majority of research efforts thus far have focused on the development of energy-efficient communication and computing mechanisms for WSNs. In this article a fundamentally different approach and hence completely new WSN paradigm, the wireless passive sensor network, is introduced. The objective of the WPSN is to eliminate the limitation on system lifetime of the WSN. In a WPSN power is externally supplied to the sensor network node via an external RF source. Modulated backscattering is discussed as an alternative communication scheme for WPSNs. The feasibility is investigated along with the open research challenges for reliable communication and networking in WPSNs.},

@article{AndrewsEtAl2008:CM08,
	Abstract = {The subject of this article is the long standing open problem of developing a general capacity theory for wireless networks, particularly a theory capable of describing the fundamental performance limits of mobile ad hoc networks. A MANET is a peer-to-peer network with no preexisting infrastructure. MANETs are the most general wireless networks, with single-hop, relay, interference, mesh, and star networks comprising special cases. The lack of a MANET capacity theory has stunted the development and commercialization of many types of wireless networks, including emergency, military, sensor, and community mesh networks. Information theory, which has been vital for links and centralized networks, has not been successfully applied to decentralized wireless networks. Even if this was accomplished, for such a theory to truly characterize the limits of deployed MANETs it must overcome three key roadblocks. First, most current capacity results rely on the allowance of unbounded delay and reliability. Second, spatial and timescale decompositions have not yet been developed for optimally modeling the spatial and temporal dynamics of wireless networks. Third, a useful network capacity theory must integrate rather than ignore the important role of overhead messaging and feedback. This article describes some of the shifts in thinking that may be needed to overcome these roadblocks and develop a more general theory.},

	Abstract = {Provision of telecommunication services by means of high-altitude platforms (HAPs) is becoming a relevant topic of interest for the research activities on future-generation systems. Mobility on demand, large coverage, and payload reconfigurability are only some examples of the expected benefits for personal communication systems based on the use of such platforms. The research regarding the use of HAPs for communications has so far neglected that they are also a privileged infrastructure for the provision of navigation and positioning services. They can act as augmentation infrastructures for global navigation satellite systems such as GPS and the future Galileo, easily performing direction of arrival estimation thanks to their high position, collecting and broadcasting position information. Despite these interesting services, the real added value is in the fact that their payload can easily integrate both communication and navigation services, with mutual benefits for both systems. The scope of this article is to discuss the feasibility of integrating HAPs with communication networks (e.g., UMTS) and navigation systems, providing an overview of different system aspects (payload, user segment)},

	Abstract = {Lossy coding of speech, high-quality audio, still images, and video is commonplace today. However, in 1948, few lossy compression systems were in service. Shannon introduced and developed the theory of source coding with a fidelity criterion, also called rate-distortion theory. For the first 25 years of its existence, rate-distortion theory had relatively little impact on the methods and systems actually used to compress real sources. Today, however, rate-distortion theoretic concepts are an important component of many lossy compression techniques and standards. We chronicle the development of rate-distortion theory and provide an overview of its influence on the practice of lossy source coding},

	Abstract = {Today, municipalities are planning to deploy metro-scale two-tier wireless mesh networks at a rapid pace. Fittingly, the IEEE 802.11s standard is being developed to allow interoperability between heterogeneous mesh network devices. In this article we describe and discuss how the initial standard addresses key factors for standardization of these networks: Efficient allocation of mesh resources at the routing and MAC layers. Protection and conservation of the network resources via security and energy efficiency. Assurance of fairness and elimination of spatial bias via mesh congestion control. We draw on examples from existing two-tier deployments, simulations, and analytical models to motivate these enhancements within the standard.},

	Abstract = {The application of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to patient care in hospitals and healthcare facilities has only just begun to be accepted. This article develops a set of frameworks based on patient life cycle and time-and-motion perspectives for how RFID can be leveraged atop existing information systems to offer many benefits for patient care and hospital operations. It examines how patients are processed from admission to discharge, and considers where RFID can be applied. From a time-and-motion perspective, it shows how hospitals can apply RFID in three ways: fixed RFID readers interrogate mobile objects; mobile, handheld readers interrogate fixed objects; and mobile, handheld readers interrogate mobile objects. Implemented properly, RFID can significantly aid the medical staff in performing their duties. It can greatly reduce the need for manual entry of records, increase security for both patient and hospital, and reduce errors in administering medication. Hospitals are likely to encounter challenges, however, when integrating the technology into their day-to-day operations. What we present here can help hospital administrators determine where RFID can be deployed to add the most value.},

	Abstract = {The satellite distribution of digital broadcast signals to the home has become widespread in the last seven years, delivering hundreds of television channels. We we have also seen other services appear, such as Direct PCTM where data is broadcast. This service may be used to deliver information like stock quotes to a large number of users, or information such as Web pages may be requested by a single user. In the latter case, however, a return path is needed from the end user to the service provider in order to provide the specific information requested by the user. In services offered today this information is usually provided by a terrestrial return link, most often a telephone line. While a telephone line with a modem is adequate in most cases, it has the drawback of tying up an existing telephone line for a considerable amount of time for very little data transmission, or requiring an additional line. Furthermore, in many parts of the world a telephone line may not be readily available. In these cases a satellite return link may be a viable option using VSATs. We describe an investigation and simulation of a return path VSAT link designed specifically for delivery of Web traffic requests to a base station and thence via a terrestrial link, using the Internet, to a Web server. The focus in this work is on the MAC protocol to support such a satellite channel and on modeling the whole service from traffic generation through transport, network, and MAC layers to the physical channel},

	Abstract = {The High Altitude Long Operation NetworkTM is a broadband wireless metropolitan area network, with a star topology, whose solitary hub is located in the atmosphere above the service area at an altitude higher than commercial airline traffic. The HALO/Proteus airplane is the central node of this network. It will fly at altitudes higher than 51,000 ft. The signal footprint of the network, its ``Cone of Commerce'', will have a diameter on the scale of 100 km. The initial capacity of the network will be on the scale of 10 Gb/s, with growth beyond 100 Gb/s. The network will serve the communications needs of each subscriber with bit rates in the multimegabit per second range. A variety of spectrum bands licensed by the FCC for commercial wireless services could provide the needed millimeter wavelength carrier bandwidth. An attractive choice for the subscriber links is the LMDS band. The airplane's fuselage can house switching circuitry and fast digital network functions. An MMW antenna array and its related components will be located in a pod suspended below the aircraft fuselage. The antenna array will produce many beams, typically more than 100. Adjacent beams will be separated in frequency. Electronic beamforming techniques can be used to stabilize the beams on the ground, as the airplane flies within its station keeping volume. For the alternative of aircraft-fixed beams, the beams will traverse over a user location, while the airplane maintains station overhead, and the virtual path will be changed to accomplish the beam-to-beam handoff. For each isolated city to be served, a fleet of three aircraft will be operated in shifts to achieve around-the-clock service. In deployments where multiple cities will be served from a common primary flight base, the fleet will be sized for allocating, on average, two aircraft per city to be served. Flight operational tactics will be steadily evolved and refined to achieve continuous presence of the node above each city. Many services will be provided, including but not limited to T1 access, ISDN access, Web browsing, high-resolution videoconferencing, large file transfers, and Ethernet LAN bridging},

The fundamental targets of this evolution - to further reduce user and operator costs and to improve service provisioning - will be met through improved coverage and system capacity as well as increased data rates and reduced latency. This article presents promising technologies to fulfil these targets, including OFDM, multi-antenna solutions, evolved QoS and link layer concepts, and an evolved architecture. Furthermore, the results of a performance evaluation are presented, indicating that the requirements can indeed be reached using the proposed technologies.},

	Abstract = {Mobile WiMAX is a fast growing broadband access technology that enables low-cost mobile Internet applications, and realizes the convergence of mobile and fixed broadband access in a single air interface and network architecture. Mobile WiMAX combines OFDMA and advanced MIMO schemes along with flexible bandwidth and fast link adaptation, creating a highly efficient air interface that exceeds the capacity of existing and evolving 3G radio access networks. WiMAX networks, built on all-IP network architecture for plug and play network deployments, can support a mix of different usage and service models. While some consider mobile WiMAX as a candidate for the fourth generation of mobile networks, others view it as the first generation of mobile Internet technologies emerging from a wider ecosystem targeting to extend the success of WiFi over wide area networks supporting mobility. This article provides a high-level overview of mobile WiMAX technology and its evolution roadmap from both radio and network perspectives.},

	Abstract = {Starting from Shannon's celebrated 1948 channel coding theorem, we trace the evolution of channel coding from Hamming codes to capacity-approaching codes. We focus on the contributions that have led to the most significant improvements in performance versus complexity for practical applications, particularly on the additive white Gaussian noise channel. We discuss algebraic block codes, and why they did not prove to be the way to get to the Shannon limit. We trace the antecedents of today's capacity-approaching codes: convolutional codes, concatenated codes, and other probabilistic coding schemes. Finally, we sketch some of the practical applications of these codes.},

@article{KidstonKunz2008:CM08,
	Abstract = {Maritime networks are one of the least studied network configurations. Such networks are composed of a number of mobile wireless nodes typical of MANETs, but also have fixed (satellite) links and are continuously powered as is typical of fixed networks. Combined, these characteristics provide unique challenges not conducive to the use of existing MANET or fixed network management techniques. Since maritime units also operate in a low-bandwidth environment with varying communications capabilities, the efficiency of network management services is critical. Similarly, the lack of power constraints and slower mobility require a less dynamic solution than that required for MANETs. This article provides an overview of the maritime network management problem space including two key management opportunities provided by such an environment. The first opportunity is in automation. Maritime networks are subject to changing operational requirements, while at the same time suffering from limited availability of skilled network operators. To rapidly respond to faults and changes in performance needs, we propose the use of a serviceoriented policy-based management architecture on which a wide variety of management services can be rapidly deployed. The second key management opportunity is resource optimization. We suggest several management services that can be used to support traffic engineering. In our simulations traffic monitoring, traffic prioritization, adaptive routing, and resource reservation services were found to provide awareness and significantly improve the timeliness of prioritized flows.},

	Abstract = {Physical layer channel modeling is critical for design and performance evaluation at multiple layers of the communications protocol stack. In this article we describe and provide results for modeling vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) wireless channels. V2V settings produce some unique conditions, and due to these conditions, V2V channels often exhibit greater dynamics than many conventional channels and, in addition, can also exhibit more severe fading. Thus, new channel models are needed to characterize this setting in order to evaluate contending transmission schemes and aid in V2V communication system design. A brief review of key statistical channel parameters is provided. Then both analytical and experimental V2V channel results are presented from the existing literature, and from our own measurement and modeling campaigns for the 5 GHz band. We also show the effects of these V2V channels on two types of transmission schemes.},

	Abstract = {Relaying and cooperation have re-emerged as important research topics in wireless communication over the past half-decade. Although multihop relaying for coverage extension in wireless networks is an old concept, it became practical only recently. Nowhere is this better illustrated than in the IEEE 802.16 working group, which has devoted a task group to incorporating relay capabilities in the foundation of mobile WiMAX-IEEE 802.16e-2005. Currently, this task group is in the process of finishing IEEE 802.16j, the multihop relay specification for 802.16. This amendment will be fully compatible with 802.16e-2005 mobile and subscriber stations, but a BS specific to 802.16j will be required for relays to operate. This article presents an introduction to the upcoming IEEE 802.16j amendment and provides insight about the obstacles that practical system designers face when incorporating relaying into a wireless broadband network.},

	Abstract = {Underwater wireless communications can enable many scientific, environmental, commercial, safety, and military applications. Wireless signal transmission is also crucial to remotely control instruments in ocean observatories and to enable coordination of swarms of autonomous underwater vehicles and robots, which will play the role of mobile nodes in future ocean observation networks by virtue of their flexibility and reconfigurability. To make underwater applications viable, efficient communication protocols among underwater devices, which are based on acoustic wireless technology for distances over one hundred meters, must be enabled because of the high attenuation and scattering that affect radio and optical waves, respectively. The unique characteristics of an underwater acoustic channel - such as very limited and distance-dependent bandwidth, high propagation delays, and time-varying multipath and fading - require new, efficient and reliable communication protocols to network multiple devices, either static or mobile, potentially over multiple hops. In this article, we provide an overview of recent medium access control, routing, transport, and cross-layer networking protocols.},

	Abstract = {A new kind of ``wireless video'' is currently entering consumers' homes-digital television. The term digital video broadcasting (DVB) is used as a synonym for digital television in many countries of the world. Whereas one may tend to think that digital television means just a new, digital, form of signal representation not necessarily affecting the information content of what one has always called TV, the truth is that digital television becomes multiple-channel data broadcasting. This article reviews some of the results of the work in the worldwide DVB Project and explains some of the fundamental concepts behind the work of this group. It then concentrates on the terrestrial transmission system (DVB-T) as one example of the many transmission technologies DVB has developed over the last few years. The COFDM modulation scheme which is a key ingredient of DVB-T is described in some detail. The performance of the system is presented. The use of DVB for data broadcasting and the accompanying return channel technologies are explained},

It serves as an introduction to the section of the special issue of the Proceedings of the IEEE in which a number of very recent DVB technologies will be explained in detail. The overview starts with an explanation of the wide field of application which the members of the DVB Project decided to address over the years. It then discusses the base band processing required for DVB services and looks into the specifications provided for the broadcasting over cable, satellite, and terrestrial transmitters. The concept of broadcasting generic data is explained and the interaction channels supported by DVB will be introduced. Multimedia Home Platform (MHP) facilitates a horizontal market of receivers able to run software programs (applications in DVB terminology)in a well defined way. After a short introduction into the specifications addressing the delivery of broadcast-type content over broad-band IP networks,the concept of broadcasting to handheld devices is introduced. The paper closes with a description of the newest areas of development DVB has decided to tackle.},

	Abstract = {The performance and complexity of signal processing systems for underwater acoustic communications has dramatically increased over the last two decades. With its origins in noncoherent modulation and detection for communication at rates under 100 b/s, phase-coherent digital communication systems employing multichannel adaptive equalization with explicit symbol-timing and phase tracking are being deployed in commercial and military systems, enabling rates in excess of 10 kb/s. Research systems have been shown to further dramatically increase performance through the use of spatial multiplexing. Iterative equalization and decoding has also proven to be an enabling technology for dramatically enhancing the robustness of such systems. This article provides a brief overview of signal processing methods and advances in underwater acoustic communications, discussing both single carrier and emerging multicarrier methods, along with iterative decoding and spatial multiplexing methods.},

	Abstract = {Acoustic propagation is characterized by three major factors: attenuation that increases with signal frequency, time-varying multipath propagation, and low speed of sound (1500 m/s). The background noise, although often characterized as Gaussian, is not white, but has a decaying power spectral density. The channel capacity depends on the distance, and may be extremely limited. Because acoustic propagation is best supported at low frequencies, although the total available bandwidth may be low, an acoustic communication system is inherently wideband in the sense that the bandwidth is not negligible with respect to its center frequency. The channel can have a sparse impulse response, where each physical path acts as a time-varying low-pass filter, and motion introduces additional Doppler spreading and shifting. Surface waves, internal turbulence, fluctuations in the sound speed, and other small-scale phenomena contribute to random signal variations. At this time, there are no standardized models for the acoustic channel fading, and experimental measurements are often made to assess the statistical properties of the channel in particular deployment sites.},

	Abstract = {The commercial advent of digital broadcast radio in the UK is upon us. The concepts and technology of digital audio broadcasting, DAB, originated from the European Eureka 147 project, which began in 1988 and which has created international standards now adopted by ETSI and the ITU. In the UK today the BBC provides DAB coverage to some 60% of the population. A DAB licence for independent radio broadcasting has been awarded to a consortium called Digital 1 which will offer a similar level of coverage within 12 months. Digital radio had been held back by a lack of consumer receivers. High-end consumer products are, however, now beginning to appear in the shops. This paper describes the development of a world-leading, credit-card-sized DAB OEM receiver module that is already allowing new players and consumer products to enter the market},

	Abstract = { This article reviews wireless enabling technologies to support interworking of heterogeneous networks, and covers two relevant topics; personal area networks and multistandard terminals. The variability of the PAN channel is demonstrated, and the implications for air interface design are discussed. To ensure the effective operation in the shared spectrum, radio resource management and medium access control strategies for PANs are also discussed. It is recognized that the terminal cost has significant implications for user acceptance; therefore, by combining the functionality from different standards (cellular, wireless LAN, broadcast), the cost can be reduced. Technologies and architectures relevant for multistandard terminals are reviewed, including synchronization and linear RF processing. Finally, the potential for further simplifications within the framework of multicarrier CDMA is considered.},

	Abstract = { Is part of the world tuning into satellite radio? Noah Samara, the chairman and CEO of WorldSpace, founded the company in 1990. Using untapped bandwidth in the gigahertz spectrum and the broad geographical coverage of a satellite beam, he envisaged a revolution in radio broadcasting. The plan was to launch three satellites into geostationary orbit to provide near-global coverage and beam digital, 'CD-quality' radio services to anyone with a receiver. Today, the WorldSpace network comprises two satellites AfriStar, launched in October 1998, and AsiaStar, launched in March 2000. Together they cover Africa, the Middle East, Western Europe and Asia. The deployment of AmeriStar, covering South and Central America, has been postponed for financial reasons. Each spacecraft broadcasts three beams, each capable of delivering more than 40 channels and ancillary data services directly to flat-panel antennas on portable receivers and to personal computer adapters. Each satellite has a bit-rate capacity of about 9 Mbit/s and service providers can choose to broadcast at data rates ranging from 16 kbit/s (for monophonic AM channels) to 128 kbit/s (comparable to stereo CD performance).},

The IEEE 802.11n will provide both physical layer and MAC enhancements. In this article we introduce some PHY proposals and study the fundamental issue of MAC inefficiency. We propose several MAC enhancements via various frame aggregation mechanisms that overcome the theoretical throughput limit and reach higher throughput. We classify frame aggregation mechanisms into many different and orthogonal aspects, such as distributed vs. centrally controlled, ad hoc vs. infrastructure, uplink vs. downlink, single-destination vs. multi-destination, PHY-level vs. MAC-level, single-rate vs. multirate, immediate ACK vs. delayed ACK, and no spacing vs. SIFS spacing.},

	Abstract = {Underwater sensor networks (USNs) promise innovative and exciting applications, viz. oceanographic data collection, environment monitoring, exploration, and tactical surveillance. Underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) though pose significant research challenges due to the harsh underwater environment. In UWSNs, acoustic is thought to be the only viable means of communication. Underwater wireless acoustic sensor networks (UW-ASNs) present a wireless channel with key challenges, specifically in shallow oceans such as long propagation delays, signal attenuation, man-made and ambient noise, low bandwidth and high transmission energy. We propose a new paradigm for UWSNs, namely underwater wireless hybrid sensor networks (UW-HSNs), which introduce the concept of hybrid communication. UW-HSNs combine the best of both worlds, i.e., the practicality of underwater acoustics and the high-performance of radio communication. The basic idea is to use radio communication for large and/or sustained traffic and traditional acoustic methods for small data volume. Furthermore, we introduce TurtleNet, an architecture based-on UW-HSNs concept, and we propose an asynchronous and distributed routing protocol for TurtleNet. Based on the nodepsilas state, the protocol decides which communication channel to utilize. TurtleNet is simulated using the ns-2 simulator. Simulation results reveal the promising performance for TurtleNet, and hence validate the UW-HSNs concept.},

It allows full roaming from operator to operator if mutual bilateral agreements are in place. The objective of security for GSM system is to make the system as secure as the public switched telephone network. The use of radio at the transmission media allows a number of potential threads from eavesdropping the transmissions. It was soon apparent in the threat analysis that the weakest part of the system was the radio path, as this can be easily intercepted},

	Abstract = { Satellite broadcasting of radio programs is an effective means of serving large and distributed markets. A space-based radio system can provide about 100 high quality music, voice, and data channels to users spread over a vast geographic area. Employing digital technology and an elaborate system design, this approach significantly outperforms traditional AM and FM radio broadcasting in signal quality, program quantity, and service availability. Motorists can enjoy their program of choice uninterrupted driving coast to coast. There are two providers of satellite radio in the USA: Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio. Both systems are expected to be fully operational in 2002. This paper will offer an overview of satellite radio and will introduce the Sirius Satellite Radio network. Field trial results including performance data and propagation characteristics will be discussed. It will be shown that satellite radio seamlessly serves both urban and rural areas.},

	Abstract = {Conventionally, underwater communications are achieved using acoustic method. However, it has its limitation. Recently, there are interests to find new methods for high bit rate, short range underwater communications. In the past, electric current method was shown to be useful for long range analog underwater communication. This paper shows that it is capable of delivering much higher bit rate digital information for short range compared to that of acoustic method. Methods to enhance the underwater communication range by focusing electric current into the desired direction are also presented.},

	Abstract = {With the advance of wireless communications technology, mobile communications has become more convenient than ever. However, because of the openness of wireless communications, how to protect the privacy between communicating parties is becoming a very important issue. In this paper, we focus on the security of transferring voice messages on the Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) networks. Stream ciphers are recommended for message encryption and decryption. First, a key generator is presented. Then, on the basis of the key generator, stream ciphers are designed with respect to different levels of securities of GSM networks. Simulation results indicate that the key generator always produces key strings of evenly distributed 0's and 1's and with infinite period. Cryptanalysis and operational analysis show that the proposed stream ciphers are secure and efficient; consequently, they provide a comprehensive set of message encryption/decryption algorithms for GSM networks},

	Abstract = {Despite the unqualified success of XM's GEO based satellite radio in the US, some skepticism remained until recently that this success could be duplicated in Europe and that a much more expensive HEO-based system would be needed to achieve the same success. This argument focused on the following challenges that a European GEO system needed to overcome: a) Low elevation angles b) Spectrum scarcity resulting from ETSI allocating only 12.5 MHz for satellite radio for all of Europe c) The large number of countries and languages to be supported The paper introduces the ETSI SDR (Satellite Digital Radio) waveform and describes its key attributes in detail to show how this key piece of technology has enabled WorldSpace to overcome the perceived limitations of a GEO system to develop and deploy the first Satellite Radio service in Europe. The key attributes discussed include the following: a) Flexibility & Spectrum Efficiency b) Fine Grain Control: dynamic service/channel level resource allocation; large number of modulation schemes supported; variable length interleaver rArr just the right QoS for each application c) Advanced FEC: Turbo Coding; large complement of code rates supported rArr Leads to additional Link Margin or capacity. The paper concludes by describing the first European Satellite Radio system developed by WorldSpace and its first results in the Milan, Italy area.},

@article{Moo:A-technique-for-orthogonal-frequency:94,
	Abstract = {This paper discusses the effects of frequency offset on the
       performance of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
       (OFDM) digital communications. The main problem with frequency
       offset is that it introduces interference among the
       multiplicity of carriers in the OFDM signal. It is shown, and
       confirmed by simulation, that to maintain signal-to-
       interference ratios of 20 dB or greater for the OFDM carriers,
       offset is limited to 4\% or less of the intercarrier spacing.
       Next, the paper describes a technique to estimate frequency
       offset using a repeated data symbol. A maximum likelihood
       estimation (MLE) algorithm is derived and its performance
       computed and compared with simulation results. Since the
       intercarrier interference energy and signal energy both
       contribute coherently to the estimate, the algorithm generates
       extremely accurate estimates even when the offset is far too
       great to demodulate the data values. Also, the estimation error
       depends only on total symbol energy so it is insensitive to
       channel spreading and frequency selective fading. A strategy is
       described for initial acquisition in the event of uncertainty
       in the initial offset that exceeds 1/2 the carrier spacing, the
       limit of the MLE algorithm},
